Hi! My name is Arush and I am a freshman at UPenn. I am passionate about exploring ways to utilize technology as a tool for social change. Please reach out at "arushm@sas.upenn.edu" if you would like to chat!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React!
- ðŸ˜€ I like to work out, drink matcha lattes, and watch TedTalks in my free time.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My favorite city that I have visited is Geneva, Switzerland.
