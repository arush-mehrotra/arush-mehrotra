Hi! My name is Arush and I am a freshman at UPenn. I am passionate about exploring ways to utilize technology as a tool for social change. Please reach out at "arushm@seas.upenn.edu" if you would like to chat and check out https://arushm.netlify.app/ to view my personal website!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning backend development.
- ðŸ˜€ I love to work out, drink matcha lattes, and watch TedTalks in my free time.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My favorite city that I have visited is Geneva, Switzerland.
